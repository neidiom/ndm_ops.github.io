  Hey there! I'm Nedim, a senior DevOps engineer. For almost 20 years, I've been taking care of Linux servers and automating cloud systems with scripts.
  
  I am most skilled in: 
  * <mark>Terraform</mark>,
  * <mark>Ansible</mark>,
  * <mark>AWS Cloud</mark> and,
  * anything <mark>Linux</mark>.

  I love writing scripts in <mark>Ruby</mark> and <mark>Python</mark>.

        title: 'Loop Platform: Audience, and Community Engagement Platform powered by GoLang Containers, React, and run on AWS Cloud'
        quote: >
          Working on this project was awesome because I had complete creative control.
        description: |
          I helped build this platform from scratch! We used <mark>Golang</mark> for the API, which is great because it creates a single binary that gets deployed as a Docker Container to <mark>AWS AppRunner</mark>.
          To keep things secure, secrets are stored in <mark>AWS Parameter Store</mark> and settings are loaded automatically during deployment.
          I wrote many AWS Lambda scripts for Slack notifications, MySQL backup, Stop/Start services, etc.
          
          Technologies used are:
          * <mark>Golang</mark> for the API,
          * <mark>React</mark> for the FrontEnd which is deployed to S3 and served by CloudFront.
          * <mark>AWS AppRunner</mark> for deploying Docker Containers,
          * <mark>Terraform</mark> as the Infrastructure as Code solution, 
          * <mark>AWS CodePipeline</mark> as the CI/CD, 
          * <mark>AWS ParameterStore</mark> as the key-value store
          * <mark>AWS CloudFront</mark> as the CDN solution.

        quote: >
          This is one of the greatest setups I worked with.
        description: |
          This company's DevOps is super impressive! Instead of using virtual machines, they built everything on physical servers and managed it all with custom Ansible code. 
          They have a central list of servers organized into groups, and amazingly, they use just one playbook to manage all of them!
          Only one playbook file is used for dozens of servers so they rely heavily on tags and groups.

          More than 50 custom Ansible roles are being used.

          All services are run from custom Docker images that are built and deployed by the custom Jenkins server. Jenkins is built with the configuration-as-code plugin. 
          Makefiles are used in combination with Jenkinsfiles.

          My tasks were to:
          - Refactor the Ansible code,
          - Introduce staging and production hosts inventory and group vars,
          - Create HashiCorp Nomad role and deploy data mining services on Nomad,
          - Create the staging Jenkins server using the configuration-as-code plugin,
          - Dockerize many <mark>Golang</mark> services.

            **I'm keeping project infrastructure running smoothly.** This includes monitoring everything, logging activity, backing things up, and making sure all the needed services are available. I'm always on the lookout for ways to improve it too.
            **I work with all kinds of servers,** from physical ones (bare metal) to cloud-based options like AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
            **I team up with the developers** to figure out the best technology for each project. I chat with them and the client to make sure we're all on the same page. Once we have a plan, I help them set everything up correctly and troubleshoot any problems.
            **Basically, I'm the infrastructure techie, making sure everything runs behind the scenes for the developers.** I use tools like Terraform for the cloud and Ansible for physical servers.

            I built services to identify, de-allocate, and shut down idle virtual machines, reducing costs. I was also involved in implementing the Branch Finder web app using a microservice architecture and deploying it on an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster.

        description: |
            Being part of this local Linux User Group was the time when I gained my first Linux skills. The local Faculty of Mechanical Engineering was the first sponsor providing us with a dedicated server with a static IP address where we run a Web and Mail server.
            Later we grew and ran the first community wireless network where we experimented with custom iptables firewalls, intranet, split DNS systems, and WDS or Wireless Distribution Systems.
